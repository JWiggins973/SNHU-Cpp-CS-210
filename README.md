In this assignment, I was tasked with creating an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. The program analyzes a text file generated throughout the day and allows users to either print the number of times a particular item was purchased, return all items purchased with their quantities, or display a histogram, depending on user input.

The aspect I did best in this project was the menu design and handling of invalid input. The menu is neat, well-aligned, and the program is robust, ensuring it doesn't crash regardless of the input. I believe I handled both tasks more efficiently than in previous assignments.

Some improvements that could be made to the code include removing the unused functions in the class and integrating all other functions into it. This would make the code more organized, so that only relevant, used functions are visible. Additionally, if the class needs to be reused elsewhere, having all necessary functions within the class makes it easier to adapt. I initially created the setters and getters in case I needed to access the name or frequency variables, but since they were not ultimately used, I left them in the code for potential future updates.

The most challenging part of this assignment was implementing a map. To overcome this, I used resources such as my professor's YouTube channel and Zybooks to gain a solid understanding, which allowed me to implement it effectively. My preferred method for learning something new is to watch a video or read a text, then open up an IDE and apply the knowledge by creating something.

The skills I developed in this project that will be transferable to others include user interface design, particularly the menu, menu loop, and input validation. Knowing how to handle these elements efficiently saves a lot of time and allows the code to be reused in almost any project requiring input validation and menu options.

I made the program more readable, maintainable, and adaptable by using functions, consistent naming conventions, sensible comments, and avoiding hard coding. Functions break the program down into smaller, manageable steps, making it easier to maintain in the future. Consistent naming and clear comments improve readability for collaborators, and avoiding hardcoding makes future maintenance simpler, as only one change would be needed instead of modifying multiple instances.
